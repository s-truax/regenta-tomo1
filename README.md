# regenta-tomo1
Processing my Kindle highlights from "La Regenta - Tomo I" into Anki flashcards.
The idea at this point is to import all the Kindle highlights, which are single words or phrases,
find the first occurance of that word or phrase in the text, create an Anki flashcard with the word
highlighted, then manually add all the definitions. I just realized that highlighting the word was
unecessary.
